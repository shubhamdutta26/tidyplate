# tidyplate

Microtiter plates or microplates have become a standard tool in analytical research and clinical diagnostic testing laboratories. They are convenient, high-throughput tools for organizing tissue culture, PCR tests (such as HIV/ COVID screening), or immunological assays such as ELISA, RIA and FIA. They offer many advantages over traditional assay formats including reduced sample and reagent volumes, increased throughput, and ease of automation. The goal of `tidyplate` is to help researchers convert different types of microplates into tidy dataframes which can be used in data analysis. `tidyplate` accepts xlsx and csv files formatted in a specific way as input. `tidyplate` supports all types of standard microplate formats namely: 6-well, 12-well, 24-well, 48-well, 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well plates.

`tidyplate` package has two functions:

  * `tidy_plate`: This function takes the input file (xlsx or csv) and transforms into a tidy dataframe.
  * `check_plate`: This function checks whether the input file is valid for use with `tidy_plate()` function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidyplate from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shubhamdutta26/tidyplate")
```

## Formating the input data file

```{r image, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "This figure demonstrates how to format the 12-well plate input file. Colors are for visualization purposes only.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README_tidy_plate.png")
```

The input xlsx or csv should be formatted in a specific way:

  * Top left corner must hold the name for that plate.
  * Column names should be: 1, 2, 3,...
  * Row names should be: A, B, C, ...
  * There must be an empty row between each plate.

## Example

This is an example which shows you how to use the `tidyplate` package. If the input file is an xlsx file it reads the first sheet by default. Users can specify sheet using the `sheet` argument for an xlsx file.

First check if the input file is valid or not:
```{r check_plate-xlsx}
library(tidyplate)
check_plate("inst/extdata/example_12_well.xlsx")
```

Import the file as a tidy dataframe:
```{r tidy_plate-xlsx}
data <- tidy_plate("inst/extdata/example_12_well.xlsx")
head(data)
```

If you want to import multiple files you can first check whether the formats for each file is good or not like so:
```{r check-xlsx}
file_list <- list.files(".", pattern='*.xlsx', recursive = T)
purrr::walk(file_list, purrr::possibly(tidyplate::check_plate, quiet = F))
```

As you can see that the first two files threw error messages. They can be removed before importing. Now you can import them using the `tidy_plate()` function.
```{r import-xlsx}
imported_list <- purrr::map(file_list, purrr::possibly(tidyplate::tidy_plate, quiet = F))
```

If a file had an error during import their corresponding list object will be empty.
```{r imported-xlsx}
imported_list[[1]]     # Empty since there was an error during import
imported_list[[3]] |>  # No errors; imported as a tibble
  head()
```
